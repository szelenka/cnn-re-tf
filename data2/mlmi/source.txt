Arafat 's organization never embraced the ideologies of the major Arab governments of the time , in contrast to other Palestinian factions , which often became satellites of nations such as Egypt , <Q796> , <Q851> , Syria and others .
According to Said Aburish , the government of Jordan and a number of Fatah commandos informed Arafat that large-scale Israeli military preparations for an attack on the town were underway , prompting fedayeen groups , such as <Q298649> 's newly formed <Q212884> -LRB- PFLP -RRB- and Nayef Hawatmeh 's breakaway organization the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine -LRB- DFLP -RRB- , to withdraw their forces from the town .

The reluctance to give accurate polling answers has sometimes extended to post-election exit polls as well .  The race of the pollster conducting the interview may factor into voters ' answers .
